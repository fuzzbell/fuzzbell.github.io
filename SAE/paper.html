        We use paper EVERY DAY, but, have you ever stopped to think about 
        what paper really is? Of course as children we are taught that paper 
        is made from trees, but this doesnt really give us a good explination 
        of what the makeup of paper is.
    </p>
    <p> 
        Papermaking is the art of, well... making paper. In order to make paper, we 
        need to first understand what paper is. paper is made from cellulose fibers, 
        usually derived from plants such as grains (and yes, wood). These fibers are 
        processed into pulp using either heat, repeated pumelling, or chemical processes. 
        finally, the pulp is screened into a flat sheet, and left to dry.
    </p>
    <p>
        The first step was to gather materials to make the paper from. While recycled paper 
        and cardboard is a popular choice, it felt like cheating to me. I decided on two materials, 
        horse Weed, and newspaper.

        I chose Horse Weed because of its woody fiberous stalk, and its cotton-like leaves. The 
        newspaper would be a backup plan, incase my Horse Weed pulp didnt turn out.
