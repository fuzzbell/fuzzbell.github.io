        We use paper EVERY DAY, but, have you ever stopped to think about<br> 
        what paper really is? Of course as children we are taught that paper<br>
        is made from trees, but this doesnt really give us a good explination<br>
        of what the makeup of paper is. 

        Papermaking is art of, well... making paper. In order to make paper, we need to first 
        understand what paper is. paper is made from cellulose fibers, usually derived from plants 
        such as grains (and yes, wood). These fibers are processed into pulp using either heat, 
        repeated pumelling, or chemical processes. they are screened into a flat sheet, and left 
        to dry.
