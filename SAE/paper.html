    <h4>
        We use paper EVERY DAY, but, have you ever stopped to think about 
        what paper really is? Of course as children we are taught that paper 
        is made from trees, but this doesnt really give us a good explination 
        of what the makeup of paper is.
    </h4>
    <p> 
        Papermaking is the art of, well... making paper. In order to make paper, we 
        need to first understand what paper is. paper is made from cellulose fibers, 
        usually derived from plants such as grains (and yes, wood). These fibers are 
        processed into pulp using either heat, repeated pumelling, or chemical processes. 
        finally, the pulp is screened into a flat sheet, and left to dry.
    </p>
    <p>
        The first step was to gather materials to make the paper from. While recycled paper 
        and cardboard is a popular choice, it felt like cheating to me. I decided on two materials, 
        horse Weed, and newspaper.

    <p>
        I chose Horse Weed because of its woody fiberous stalk, and its cotton-like leaves. The 
        newspaper would be a backup plan, incase my Horse Weed pulp didnt turn out.
    </p>
    <p>
        Next i had to prep the materials for pulping. After some quick research, i decided i would 
        first bake the Horse Weed, cut them into 1" pieces, and boil with soda ash until the stalks 
        softened. A similar story for the newspaper, except no baking!

    <h4>After boiling for almost two hours, i was still not satisfied with how hard the stalks remained, but
     i decided to move on because of how bad the smell was, among other things.</h4>
    <p>The next process is the most importient one, which is pulping. At this point, all of the fibers remained intact;
    The purpose of pulping is to separate these fibers, and further soften them. I chose to use a kitchen blender (much to 
    the dismay of my mom) to break down the plant.</p>

    <p>After the pulp was thuroughly blended, it was put into mason jars and left for a few days while i set up the pulling station.</p>

    <h4>Last but not least, i had to pull the sheets. Papermaker's use two tools known as the mould, and the deckle. I was able 
    to make these from $5 worth of wood, and some window screen. The mould is a wooden frame with a tight mesh on one side, and
     the deckle is just a wooden frame. when put together, you get a sort of screening apparatus, used for separating the water from 
    the pulp, and setting the pulp into a paper shape.</h4>

    <h4>The next process was what i was most scared of. Pulling the paper could go one of two ways, fine, or not fine. I started
        by simmering chopped okra in a skillet until the water stopped becoming thicker. This okra-mixture acts as a forming agent, helping 
        the pulp to stick together once pulled.

        <p>Now, all i had to do was suspend the pulp, pull the sheets, and dry. I strted by opening the jars of pulp i had made 
            previously, and i notices that little larvae had survived all the processing, and had been growing in the medium, which didnt 
            enitrely suprise me. 
        </p>
        <p>I started by filling up a large container with water, and added in two of the three jars of Horse Weed pulp, and about half of my recycled pulp.</p>
