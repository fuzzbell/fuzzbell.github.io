        What makes a newscast? 
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:160%; margin-left:25; text-indent: 25">
        News, at its core, is just information; a newscast, however, is a method of presenting that information to the public. A newscast is usually broken down into segments, each segment relating to an informational story or piece of information(A.K.A, a piece of news).

        Legal and ethical concerns within news production
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:160%; margin-left:25; text-indent: 25">
        In order for a newscast to remain impartial, present news objectively, and be true to the viewer, several considerations have to be made. here, I will cover a few.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:160%; margin-left:25; text-indent: 25">
        In the US, filming people without their consent is legal as of the first amendment. News stations have to consider people's privacy for safety, even if it is perfectly legal to disregard.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:160%; margin-left:25; text-indent: 25">
        The cost of production at news stations often runs high, so news stations are rarely ever non-profit; in order to make money, news statons take sponsorships and advertise.
        Advertisers can threaten to cut funding if the station airs anything that the advertiser doesnt want their name on, which causes the news station to loose some of their transparency.

        Stages of news production
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:160%; margin-left:25; text-indent: 25; font-weight: bold">
        1. Planning
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:160%; margin-left:50; text-indent: 25">
        Planning is a broad catagory that includes processes like gathering news, brainsorming stories, fact checking, negotiating with advertizers, and general organization. What this often looks like is producers and directors making a rough outline of the newscast,
        complete with how it will be produced.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:160%; margin-left:25; text-indent: 25; font-weight: bold">
        2. Production
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:160%; margin-left:50; text-indent: 25">
        Production is the stage where the outine made in the planning stage gets filmed, composited, and edited together.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:160%; margin-left:25; text-indent: 25; font-weight: bold">
        3. Distribution
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:160%; margin-left:50; text-indent: 25">
        In the distribution stage, a newscast gets aired to the public via radio and satellite television, as well as online.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:160%; margin-left:25">
        I have experience with all of the stages of news production, here are three examples of newscasts that I have (in this order) produced, anchored in, and filmed.

        Collage & career
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:160%; margin-left:25; text-indent: 25">
        I have many interests which I would like to pursue as career paths, all of which I am trying to learn more about/ get better at while I'm still on someone else's insurance bill.
        Some of these areas of interest include (but are not limited to) Botany & mycology, Design & manufacturing, Film production, Electrial engineering, and co-ed cheerleading.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:160%; margin-left:25; text-indent: 25">
        I'm still not sure if collage would be worth it for me, ideally I would like to be picked up by a cheerleading scholarship (which I've already been approached about), 
        but if not, then I would like to get a job woodworking, coaching, or at a machine shop until I can afford to even think about applying to a collage.
