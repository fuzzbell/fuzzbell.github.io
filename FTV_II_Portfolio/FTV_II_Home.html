        What makes a newscast? 
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:160%; margin-left:25; text-indent: 25">
        News, at its core, is just information; a newscast, however, is a method of presenting that information to the public. A newscast is usually broken down into segments, each segment relating to an informational story or piece of information(A.K.A, a piece of news).

        Legal and ethical concerns within news production
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:160%; margin-left:25; text-indent: 25">
        In order for a newscast to remain impartial, present news objectively, and be true to the viewer, several considerations have to be made. here, I will cover a few.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:160%; margin-left:25; text-indent: 25">
        In the US, filming people without their consent is legal as of the first amendment. News stations have to consider people's privacy for safety, even if it is perfectly legal to disregard.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:160%; margin-left:25; text-indent: 25">
        The cost of production at news stations often runs high, so news stations are rarely ever non-profit; in order to make money, news statons take sponsorships and advertise.
        Advertisers can threaten to cut funding if the station airs anything that the advertiser doesnt want their name on, which causes the news station to loose some of their transparency.

        Stages of news production
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:160%; margin-left:25; text-indent: 25; font-weight: bold">
        1. Planning
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:160%; margin-left:50; text-indent: 25">
        Planning is a broad catagory that includes processes like gathering news, brainsorming stories, fact checking, negotiating with advertizers, and general organization. What this often looks like is producers and directors making a rough outline of the newscast,
        complete with how it will be produced.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:160%; margin-left:25; text-indent: 25; font-weight: bold">
        2. Production
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:160%; margin-left:50; text-indent: 25">
        Production is the stage where the outine made in the planning stage gets filmed, composited, and edited together.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:160%; margin-left:25; text-indent: 25; font-weight: bold">
        3. Distribution
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:160%; margin-left:50; text-indent: 25">
        In the distribution stage, a newscast gets aired to the public via radio and satellite television, as well as online.

        <p style="font-size:100%; color:#EDEDEB">
            This installment of ATV was produced by none other than yours truly. I had seen everyone else in the class take the producer job, and proceed to loose their mind amidst
            their lack of organization. I saw this as a challange; I picked the producer job, made two iterations of a rundown origination sheet complete with estemated time quota and job statuses. 
            I made sure people were where they were supposed to be, what they were supposed to do, and how. after all was said and done, I realized how difficult producing really is.

            The #1 thing that this class has tought me is how difficult being on camera really is, 
            followed closely by how boring I am on camera. Anchoring is a lot of waiting around and tricking your mind into reading scripts.

            I was able to get a lot of experience handling cameras during the semester, and I can say with certainty that I know how to open the SD card cover. Along with that, I really enjoyed learning about different types of shots and their uses, and all of the creative techniques that go into filming. Even though filming anchors is more set-and-forget than something like a news story, I learned the importiance of proper framing and lighting, and general camera safety.

            Graveside was a community owned skatepark which I spend a lot of my free time at. Unfortunately, it's getting town down. I thought this would make a really good news story
            as every skater at athens basically lives there. If you look past the lack of tripods, I think this video turned out very well. I started by coming up with a basic outline of the story 
            and all the different clips I'd need for it. I messaged the main owner to ask for an interview, 
            and the next day I went over to film. After I collected all the clips, made the graphics, and got permission from everyone in the video, I edited it together over the course of two class periods.

        Collage & Career
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:160%; margin-left:25; text-indent: 25">
        I have many interests which I would like to pursue as career paths, all of which I am trying to learn more about/ get better at while I'm still on someone else's insurance bill.
        Some of these areas of interest include (but are not limited to) Botany & mycology, Design & manufacturing, Film production, Electrial engineering, and co-ed cheerleading.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:160%; margin-left:25; text-indent: 25">
        I'm still not sure if collage would be worth it for me, ideally I would like to be picked up by a cheerleading scholarship (which I've already been approached about), 
        but if not, then I would like to get a job woodworking, coaching, or at a machine shop until I can afford to even think about applying to a collage.
